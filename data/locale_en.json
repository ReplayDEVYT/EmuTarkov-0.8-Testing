Your character is a contract operator of a Private Military Company (PMC), caught into the maelstrom of events right after Contract Wars. The area is sealed off, your operational command is not responding, former mission objectives have lost their purpose. Everybody has personal goals now - adapt and survive, exfiltrate the blockade of take control of others' lives by attempting to save them. \n \n \nEvery single game session, be prepared to die and lose everything you had with you. Keep in mind, that every drop in your internet connection or network hardware malfunction can lead to disconnection from the game with consecutive death of you character and loss of all the stuff you had with you or found in the session. \n \nYes, you will die, and, most probably, very often, but remember  - this is still a game.

      "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f57e": "Damn... Apparently, I was wrong to count on you. Nothing I can help you with. I’m neck-deep in the problems now thanks to your half-assed war.",
      "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f57f": "Thank you, warrior. Well, your hobo used to dwell on the railway, in the train car next to the boiler. My guys have seen him there often. See you later.",
      "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f580": "How long I live and wonder still. How was he surviving all this time? He can’t put two words together! Whatever. Let's first disinfect all this and wash it with Cologne, and then open and have a look.",
      "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f581": "It seems, this problem is not solved, only got more complicated. Well, whatever. Come what may.",
      "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f582": "Well, great. Now it’s time to get as far as possible while they do their experiments. We can have a look later.",
      "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f583": "Oh you bloody bastard! Everything down the damn drain! Biatch, so much effort just wasted!  The hell is wrong with you? You’re a sensible dude, not air-headed. Ah, to hell with you, spoiled such a jackpot! No way I’m letting you in on something serious.",
      "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f584": "Now that is right on! Well now we’re tied up good, bro. Awesome that you didn’t chicken out at the last moment. Now I can fill you in on really serious business.",
      "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f585": "I have nothing to say. It scares me to think of who and why might need this chemical.",
      "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f586": "Wonderful! I can only imagine how would the Skier be vexed, but, really, this gunk is best kept under control of the competent people",
      "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f587": "Well, damn. Well, why the heck are you courting this Skier so? Buffs you with cash? Promised you a share? But to hell with him, and you too",
      "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f588": " Nicely done! My guys will show up presently and get this out in no time. Grab your spoils.",
      "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f589": "Bless you, Rambo, again. I don't know how you manage it, none of my business anyway, but working with you is comfortable. Won’t be surprised to start worrying about you soon.",
      "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f58a": "Great job! There is still plenty of uglies left, but it's a start anyway.",
      "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f58b": "Nailed it, huh? Nice! Grab your reward. I bet it's not the last job from my comrades.",
      "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f58c": "I understand, it's no easy task to waste these douche bags in an instant like a fucking meteor. No big deal, just regroup and try again.",
      "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f58d": "Look at you, a Punisher if I ever saw one! There's rumour going about that some monster is bagging the scum in numbers. My cronies send you their regards and some splendid presents.",
      "5ab0f32686f7745dd409f58e": "Wonderful! Happy to work with you again, you have my trust again.",

It’s the first time I see you, and no offense, but I’ve lived too long to trust people right away, so you’ll have to prove how tough you are in the field. There’s no shortage of would-be tough guys in our fair town lately, y’know. Then we’ll see, if you’re worth something, greeting might get warmer, prices lower, and stuff cooler. Fair enough, right? Okey-dokey then. Since you agree, for starters, waste, let’s say, three deadbeats around the Customs and bring me 3 MR-shotguns as proof.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da46": "How’s it going, warrior? Still in one piece? Good. Look, there's a problem. If you pull through, we could talk trust. Interested? Look here then. I had a pal who drove the tank truck at the factory. Managed to take the family out, but returned to get the stuff and perished. He lived in a dorm, the bigger one. Can’t remember the room, I was there only once, and wasted as hell to boot. There was a poster of some chick on the wall for sure, the rest is foggy. To cut the long story short, he had old bronze pocket watch with a chain. Sort of a family heirloom. If it wasn’t snatched by anyone, then there are two options - either it’s hidden in his room somewhere, or in his car. I want to get it out for the kid, his old man was not exactly a dipshit, worth to be remembered.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da47": "Alive and well? Atta boy! Not everyone can boast the same nowadays. Apparently, you can handle a thing or two. That’s good. You have an idea of tactics, so here is the challenge. You know the sawmill area? Theere. Some trusted people have matters to attend to in the area, but local scum that, in lack of good sense, think of themselves as masters of the place, keep interfering with them. According to my intel, these dickheads are no more than eight strong, should not be a problem for a salty war dog, with the right approach. What do you say?\n",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da48": "Stay well, fighter. Still in our fallen world, I see? But enough of that. There is one thing. So to say, rather sensitive. We kind of reached trust with you? So I’ll be trusting you now. I won’t go into details of why who and for what, not really related to task at hand. And the task is to procure a package and move it to another place. Doesn’t sound hard, but there is a nuance. The pickup is at the Customs, and drop-off in the Factory. Interested?",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da49": "Stay in good health, dear comrade. Step inside. There’s job to do, if you’re interested. Need to find one piece of crap, and I’m at my wits’ end how. Briefly - one of the foremen who worked on that fecking Polikim, has just in time laid his hands on some pretty heavy documents. You know, for sure, how hard is everyone still gunning for any evidence on TG and its associates? So it goes. But the folks who tried to get the info out of that foreman happened to be more edgy than smart. Dude’s ticker stopped ticking before his tongue started wagging. Can you imagine? What dimwits! How do you do business with the likes of them? Okay, back to the point. So he grabbed the docs and stashed them somewhere. Asked around a bit, those who worked with him before. In general, chances don’t look too good, but who knows how lucky you can get? In a word, that foreman worked in the chemo shop. The shitmost shit, see. And somewhere on the factory premises he and his homies had their bunkhouses. Chowing there, relaxing, most certainly inviting broads over etc. I figure it’s holed up there somewhere, most likely. If it’s not there, then we won’t find crap at all.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da4a": "Hey there, fighter. Still fighting? Good. There is this job, a trifle, really. Obviously not your caliber, so not a business, but a favor, so to say. There’s a package for me, they stashed it in the bunker behind the sawmill. 60-rounds for fiver. You know, popular product. So, there they’ve put a lock up on the grill to ward out drifters. Terra Group people used to hang around there in their time, and one of their brass has a copy of the key stored somewhere. He lived somewhere in the dorm by the Factory. So go on and check around. 30% goes to you on return. In fact, if you don’t manage it into the bunker, then find them elsewhere - I’ve got a pressing order.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da4b": "Come on in, make yourself at home. How the life of battle? No extra preternatural holes in your hide? Jolly good. No freaking use for them, eh? I’m in bit of a tight unpleasant spot here. Will you help me out? My messenger vanished. Relied, dammit, on that local waste of skin, played so tough all the time. In short, I’ve sent a little note to the Therapist with some proposals for mutually beneficial cooperation. Nothing special, but nothing outsiders should know either. And so this meat sack is missing, and a little bird told me that the postman got whacked somewhere in the Factory. Why the heck would he go there, that moron? Told him to go straight. Well, find a body and check it, maybe my scribbles are still there. And if by some miracle they are, hand it to Ms. MD, will ya?",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da4c": "Good afternoon. Prapor told me that you are the one young man who will help us to reconnect and find the lost letter. Great! I’ll be waiting.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da4d": "Hail, the knave of axe and gun. Curious info came up recently. Smells like solid profit without running around too much. Ready? Look. There was that wisecrack who run the stores, lived in a dorm by the factory. And, as usual, sidelined some cash. He lived in room 214. But this is not the point. I don’t think you will find much there, if anything at all. Though he swore there’s something. Something else has surfaced: In the same dorm, he owned one more room, 203, but wasn’t babbling about it and, as a matter of fact, used it for storage. Now that’s where he had something of value for sure, more than one of his errand runners perished there. Also, he had a garage. Don’t know the number, but certainly two-digit - I have a listing of owners starting with 100, and his name is not there.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da4e": "Hello, mercenary. Are you interested in job, by any chance? Very well. Work is not hard for a gritty man like you, and won’t end up in losing. I can always provide food and drinks, and, most importantly - skilled medical care, in cases of almost any complexity. And for my loyal clients, who do not mind helping me with my business, I offer preferential terms for goods and services. But it's up to you for the future. If you prove that you’re reliable. In the meantime, here's a simple task - I need to obtain 5 emergency medical care kits. Go around as Salewa, the red ones. Know these? That’s what I need. Alternatively, they can be purchased from the one called Skier. You know him? I could do it myself, but our relationships are rather strained. So if you take them from him, better not mention me. Otherwise, I suspect, the price will immediately change, and not in your favor.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da4f": "Good afternoon. I have an urgent job for you. It is important for all who still live or, more precisely, exist in our woeful region. You know where the chemical factory is? Doesn’t matter now what was produced there and what is happening there now. I mean, who controls it or who tries to secure it. I have firm suspicion that some sort of poison is leaking from the factory premises into the groundwater. And because of the lack of supplies from the outside, we are all forced to drink this water. Do you understand? Even the filters are no longer effective. If we do not resolve this issue, nobody will need ammo and grenades before long. To figure it out I need the readings of radio and gas analyzers, which should be in the factory shops next to the water pumps. Look for a small separate room right in the shops and there they should be.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da50": "Glad to see you, young man. I have a well-paid job for you. Since you are already aware of the problems with drinking water in the region and the origin of these problems, I can entrust you with the following information. We found out what exactly is contaminating the aquifer and we know how to stop it. We need a few more days, but it will be done. Qualified engineers are already on it. But until then will have to survive on the remaining scarce reserves. Which are very scarce indeed. However, to my knowledge, some people managed to make hay and stock up on clean water prior to the pollution. This is the gang that inhabits the dorm area next to the factory. Several people saw them carrying large plastic barrels with water there. Can’t blame them for trying to survive the way they can, but they do not need as much, they just do not know that in a few days everything will be solved. And due to the lack of water, many may not live up to this point. Please locate where they store their water supplies and tell me.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da51": "Glad to see you once again. My people found out who was involved in all of these illegal operations with clean water. Thanks to your information, of course. Well, it’s a gang of Scavs operating in the Customs area. I’m really not comfortable with this kind of requests, but there are lives at stake, and these scoundrels go on with their dirty business. We need to properly harass them - I think I don’t need to explain further what it means. Will you do it?",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da52": "There is more work, if you are interested. I think you have already understood, that I support the civilians remaining in shelters, who, unfortunately, didn't have the time to get out of the perimeter. In fact, all your fights are just means of achieving the goal for me. And the goal is to help the innocent people to survive until the possible end of this nightmare. Or until evacuation. You strike me as more-or-less normal person, not yet an utterly devolved monster like most of your peers who come to me. Therefore, I shall ask you. I need morphine. And not for sale to drug addicts. I am a doctor after all, young man, and gave the oath. Many civilians are injured because of your constant firefights. Stray bullets, grenade fragments. And there are women, and the elderly, and children. And they are not combat-hardened thugs, they can not, and should not, endure such pain, biting on the rifle sling. I know that USEC used to carry supplies of single-use syringes in their SUVs. Get me at least ten of those.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da53": "I want to ask you of service. Don't put up that look, of course not for free! In a small dorm, yes, the one inhabited by those bandits, somewhere on the first floor used to live a young paramedic from the factory. Unfortunately, I do not know the room number - when my colleagues and I were his guests on the Medical Worker Day, it was already dark, and in the middle of a party, you see. Well, he was a young specialist, still an intern, but very enthusiastic. Planned to enroll in the Military Medical in St. Petersburg. And in his safe, right there in the room, he kept a case with particular new medical device. Issued to him by the employer. He tried to get out of town on his blue VAZ 2109 with St. Petersburg plates. I don't know if he managed it or not, but as far as I have heard, he either got stuck near the gas station, or apprehended by the military. In any case, I could really put that tool to good use. Come the dark hour, and you might need it as well. Not that I wish that to happen, don’t get me wrong, but... I assume you understand everything better than me. Look for it. Yes, I almost forgot, we have common interests with Arshavir in this matter. He has a good product for you. After successfully completing the task, of course.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da54": "Hello, young man. Truly glad to see you. I have a very important assignment, not for everybody to take on. Will you take it? Then listen. Do you know the sawmill in the Woods? So, during the Contract Wars period it was used as one of makeshift backup supply bases for TerraGroup. And I am very interested in TerraGroup supply plans in this region. I think they should be somewhere on the territory as well. Try to search the temporary quarters for workers - this should be a secure case for documents with a special symbol.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da55": "A little bird told me that you want to find some folder and pass to on to the medic. You do realize that we have a business here, and I have my own interest in disrupting her operations. A kind of sabotage, eh? Come on, bring this folder to me, and I’ll treat you right, send some proper cash your way, and there will be more trust for you. The hell I need it for? Don’t play dumb, take a guess. I’m opening branches here, building up the operation, and quality chow from those who’ve been preparing for all this crap in advance, will sell like hotcakes through my channels. But I’m rambling, come on, on your way, I'll be here packing your cash.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da56": "Hello again. I have a temporary shortage with lasting foods in the form of canned meat. Can you help? I need a reserve 30 cans of beef. And I know I couple of places where we can get them. Of course, our Scav friends. They used to have a storeroom at the gas station near the Factory - maybe there's still something left. Another food storage was somewhere in the dormitories, with more than canned goods there. But now I’m only interested in them, so you’re free to take the rest for yourself. Deal? I know that these two gangs are allied, but to prevent theft from the warehouses by their own people, their leaders have exchanged keys from each other's warehouses. So it should be pretty easy for you, I think.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da57": " Hello. Good that you are here. I have a job just for you, since you are already familiar with it. Our engineers have successfully neutralized chemical leak from the factory, but the water is still not fully rectified. Although only remaining pollutants are specific to petroleum products. We assume that this is connected to the TPP fuel oil storage next to the factory. Know these? It’s hard to miss, there's a big stack. Technical rooms of fuel oil storage and furnace facility must be nominally equipped with the same radio- and gas analyzers you found in the factory, if, of course, they weren’t stolen yet. Locate and bring them in and we will solve the water problem in the region, at least for a while.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da58": "Good afternoon, young man. Need help with a good cause. As you have long guessed, I collect food, medicine and other necessities in order to evacuate the people. I don't want to deceive you, this is true. And now they have enough reserves for the road. And most importantly, through my channels I’ve managed to negotiate on the other side for these people to be met let through. Can you imagine? But only the civilian population, no men under 60. Therefore, the first wave will mostly be children with mothers and a few elderly people. Almost everything is ready, except for one little detail - we need transportation. We have several vehicles, just enough to carry everyone from the first wave, but they are not running. They have been idle for too long, as I was told, and need batteries and spark plugs. Even fuel is not necessary. Four batteries and 8 plugs. Can you get that?",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da59": "Not a good time! Although... Hang on. There is an urgent matter. There was a firefight about an hour ago in the garages across the river. Just where my errand boy was headed. To hell with him, he was a total jerk anyway. But he had with him one particular key. A mighty complex key, I might add. To the door that can be freaking whereever, see? This clown was delivering me one very valuable thing. Hid it somewhere, bastard, locked it with this arsetormenting key, and came to me to talk up the price. What a biatch! I sort of raised the fee a bit, for the thought, but this wanker still haven’t told me where and went to get it himself. And I’m almost sure he’s got done in there. Find the key, and then find me the package even if you have to check all doors from the center to the port.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da5a": "Ah, it's you again. Decided to hang tight onto me then. Bloody awesome. I need to stir up some movement in our region. All sorts of outsiders keep popping up meddling with business, shoot, loot valuables off my guys, whack them  indiscriminately. That makes me kinda unhappy, so to say, does not fall in line with my business concept. Well, go and rake them bopperators of yours, and I’ll pay the bounty for every head, and even something extra for present on top. Times are hard, and you have to make a living here somehow - preferably a good one.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da5b": "I’ve seen tougher, not often tho. Ha! Screw it, whatever. I have a con here. What’s with that look? Don't like the lingo? Yep, I did time, and? Why the bad eye? Two stretches, one in a juvie, second - two years in minimum security for disorderly conduct. Enough? We done with that? Finally, we can go without gracious wordweaving! So look, there is this con. Can’t say failproof, but likely interesting. One drunken punk’s been blabbing that over the Contract Wars he used to guide several groups of VIPs who did not want to run into our troops or cops. And I agree with the latter. It’s still possible to deal with war dogs, normal people are not uncommon among them, but cops are no damn good. Well, in the end, he walked through several such parties. Oh and fool as he his, he still had enough sense to steal everything he could during stops. Now he swears with his mom’s name, that deadbeat, that he snatched two flash drives on his latest run. What was on them - if anything at all - he’s got no clue. And he’s been permanently shit-faced for so long that he can’t remember anything at all - no location, no landmarks, nothing. Anyhow, he says there were some big kahunas with security detail, so might be worth a while. Check all possible campsites. I know that these paths have been beaten through and through since, but what if, all of a sudden?",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da5c": "Do you take side jobs on your main profession? Hehe. What a hypocritical world! I pulled a trifling stretch for roughing some punk up, and my lingo gets me scoffed at by a nutcase who drops people down in numbers without a trace of remorse! And where is the justice? That’s right. As my prosecutor said, it's there, beyond the wall. And we are all here, as in one big pen. See the point, no? Whatever, I drifted off the wrong way. Well, the task is easy. A group of Scavs is infesting the factory. And one of their pins is a character who goes by the handle of Uruguay. What a retarded alias to choose. What a shame, who the hell gives birth to such morons? But I digress. The objective is finishing his earthly path. But this is only half the battle. He has a lighter, sort of lucky charm. The gilded Zibbo, fidgets it all the time in his claws. Dropped by my place, and, sure, went on clicking it. And, by the way, he lived in the dorms, room 303. So, I need this light to be carefully dropped off in one safehouse for somebody to get properly flabbergasted, and maybe take a hint. Got it? So it goes. That safehouse is at the Customs, in a closed bunkhouse next to the trailer parking area. Here is a key to it. Good luck.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da5d": "Polikhim hobo? The former security deputy chief? Yes, I knew him. All this mess caused him some massive damage - took to drinking, degraded to hobo. And he wasn’t a bad guy... Wait a sec, can’t he say for himself? Got whacked or something? Well, doesn't matter, apparently, once you ask, then there are some problems. Well, I knew where he lived, but here’s the deal - I need help scaring off the Scavs from the Customs. I you help me, I’ll tell you where this hobo lived. But there is one more thing - I need it done right away, in the next 48 hours.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da5e": "So, Sherlock, you want a riddle? You’re our pro on these headcrackers, right? Here, look. One lame hobo came around here. Either nuts of just demented, hell if I knew. All in rags, dirty head to toe, and the stench! A walking chemical weapon. Launched one on some vector, and where he goes, everything dies off. Hehe. Oh, damn, laughter through tears. But I digress. Just wanted to dispose of him, a bit farther away so the stink wouldn’t reach us, but one of our boys recognized his former homie in that pile of turd. Imagine that! Horrid things are going on, turning people from normal to such rubbish for shit! But not the point. The dude that recognized this heap of rags, said that he was not just a regular prick, but a Deputy Head of Security for two special sensitive zones on the Polikhim! Just imagine what kind of source could he become if he could at least remember his name, not just chew snots and mumble while slapping lips like mad. What a shame! I don't know what got to him, but here's what I think. All this time that bagger existed somewhere, sleeping on some pissed-through mattresses? Right! You should look for that. Need a hazmat suit? Haha, kidding. But if it comes to it, the hazmat’s on me, and not only it.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da5f": "Got tired of waiting already. Documents that you got from the den of this humanoid weigh quite a bit. Pretty heavy they are. But this is damn dangerous cargo. And there is no clarity, who will be the best buyer for it. And it's not even so much about the profit, as it is about getting some enormous freaking problems if we choose the wrong addressee. So here the key that you found there as well, and try to dig up further.  My guys said it's from a dorm room. And judging from the documents, our deputy chief was seen on the second floor of the first building. Any info you could find in this room can come in very handy, and the prize will be impressive.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da60": "That envelope from the dorm contained some chemical formula. And a reaction process described on the flash drive. We found a guy here who’s good with the subject. So he said that they cooked up something at Polikhim, experimenting with some blue liquid shiet, adding crap there. Well, I wasn’t into chemistry at school! All sorts of chemicals, valences, indecent bonds! Oh, damn! Hehe. But you see, I still remember some words. That was some teaching! But whatever. It is necessary to confirm the experiment described there. And then this matter will shine upon us with new colors. This blue shit is abundantly scattered in barrels throughout the region, still nobody knows what it is. And nobody is too eager to figure that out either. But we will take our chance and find out. And make some profits with it. But this requires another stuff, It should be somewhere in the factory. There was a room filled with garbage - they had a laboratory there. Look for bright yellow sort of syringe, looks like a pen, like morphine syringe. Well, you get the idea.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da61": "Here’s the thing. This whole chemical deal worked like a charm, and it immediately became clear who do we push it to. And the receiving party is ready. Only one issue left to resolve. Find more of these yellow chemicals. The crux of the issue was partly resolved before us -someone has already tried. Don't know, consciously or not, but if you believe the consignment notes from the same docs, the whole box of that stuff was already tried to be taken out from the factory. But this cargo was not logged on any of the checkpoints, so I figure it’s worth looking for somewhere in the factory. And not just one lousy syringe, but a crate. Look out for some markings maybe, the box should have them. Seen? Ah One more thing. My sweet, sweet friends Prapor and Therapist popped up, poking around. So come on, don’t turn coat. Just a bit more and we’ll be running this place. Good luck, bruh. I'll tell about you to Ragman - he'll get for you to buy some helmets. Really good ones!",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da62": "Young man, I could not stand aside on this one. I'm aware that you are now working with the so-called Skier. This disreputable man pursues completely lucrative interests and that is a matter of great concern to me. Especially all this story with secret experiments on a substance that you call the yellow chemical. The substance is extremely dangerous, and I have a major request for you, could you give up the coordinates of the chemicals to me? Yes, I'm aware of all the details of your adventures with the Skier. I would come up with a good payment for that. Again, this is all just for the sake of our people.",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da63": "Hail! Our world is small - I found that you’re teaming up with Skier lately. Let’s go straight to business - I need to know where to get that chemical of yours, big customer wants to buy out all the boxes at a good price. I don’t care why he needs it, I’m a bit tighter on funds now that I would like to be. Are you in?",
      "5abe61a786f7746ad512da64": "This mug looks familiar! Hello there, drifter. Good timing, I’ve been pondering on some business here. A little bird asked me to check out the area where might still be some fuel remaining. Hot topic, you understand, not for just anybody to charge with. And here you step in! Lucky me. Cutting it short, you’ve handled beacons before, right? No rocket science - stick it somewhere out of sight, press the button, get out. Got it? Excellent, all that’s left is to find and mark the tanks. Here, take those beacons. Consider it a token of appreciation for our successful partnership.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da65": "Well then, it's about time we make this world a better place. Shoreline is under increasingly frequent attacks of different bands, seriously interfered with my friends operations. Help them sort it out and we'll send a handsome reward your way.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da66": "My friends were mighty pleased with what you did, and they definitely want some more. More profit in it for you, too, as well as some extra gear, so go on, keep doing good things for good people. Ah, almost forgot. They are asking for half-masks, you know, those that Scavs hide their faces with. No idea what they need them for, to make a point or something.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da67": "Hey there, man. Well, my friends are clearly up to something. Last time you dropped some Scavs, they called me almost instantly, and, you know, it seemed like they had a bit of an entertainment going on. Making bets, making cash. Long story short, they want you to decimate Scavs again, but this time at Customs and with time limit. I don't really want to know what kind of show must go on, but they offer some top cash, so, how about it?",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da68": "You know, I wonder why are you working with such a scumbag as the Skier! Even though of closing my doors for you, young man. But I see that you want to set this unpleasant situation straight. Good... I have a task for you - do it and we’ll put the past behind us. Although people will hardly forget - God only knows whose hands got these chemicals now.  Basically, my colleagues are going to search all the more or less significant objects in the district, looking for supplies for the suffering people. However, they failed to gain access to some places. Find particular keys and hand them over to me, thus helping our operation. To hell with the Skier, let's help people.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da69": "Well hello, hello. That last trick you pulled was total shit for sure. I thought of ordering your quick demise, mister fancypants. Well, since you’re here I guess you want to amend for your sins. It’s simple with me, like taking candy from a baby - my trust can be bought. 1 million in rubles - and we’ll forget about past misunderstandings.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da6a": "That last chemical deal damaged my trust in you. I’m not the type to hold on to grudges, but that trick you pulled was mean, I don’t like acts like that. If you want to straighten things up with me and regain trust - do one favor for me. The customer who expected these chemicals was left in a tight spot, and on top of that, I haven’t even delivered the grenades from the previous order yet. The grenades he needs are foreign-made, I don’t have anything like that. Get me some of these - and we’ll call it even, as if nothing happened.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da6b": "Hey, your last Scav cutting was off the chain!\nPeople keep coming and asking what the heck is going on. Turns out that my friends somehow negotiated with the local authorities - what’s left of them anyways - to set up a kind of mercenary fights, like gladiators. Imagine that! We just keep falling back to the Middle Ages with all this shit! In short, for them you are, what’s it called... Tester, sort of. Whatever they are coming up with, they reevaluate and adjust according to your actions. Long story short, I don’t really understand shit, but they suggest to continue. Are you in?\n",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da6c": "Masters - as my friends started calling themselves - are moving on. Now they need the stuff for developing this whole gladiator thing further.  Honestly, I’m not too hot for all these moves - I don't like how this keeps spreading chaos. So come on - find everything they need yourself, and just hand over to me, I’ll pass it on on your behalf.\n",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da6d": "Hey there! I don't know... I want out from these Masters deals. The PMCs are getting closer up their ass. Surprisingly, they don’t want to shut it down, but take over instead!  Always thought of them as our guys, but somehow that is... unsound. But in times like these everybody goes a little bonkers, everybody feels the end is nigh. Briefly, that’s my last deal with them, won’t be doing anything for them anymore. Basically, they want BEARs to be heavily reduced throughout the area. And quickly. They’ll drop in some misinformation to kick off the action. No word on who’s trying to be the smartass, so you’ll just have to drop them without much distinction. I don’t like it at all. However, the bounty is veeery tempting. So, it’s up to you.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da6f": "translation_pending",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da70": "On to business. You've done quite a lot useful services. Keep it this way, and I think I could let you in on the greatest secrets. We have one delicate matter to tackle, which should yield considerable profits. You've probably seen the Cote d'Azur health resort, a beautiful facility, is it not? The matter involves some activities inside I can’t say more yet. However, observation data reveals that there are way too many Scavs in that area, their groups showing acute interest to everything that can be looted. Our aim is to explain them in most democratic of means that the resort is closed for maintenance. I know you are good at it.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da71": "Good day, my friend. While you were dealing justice, you surely noticed the helicopter standing at the health resort pad. We need to hurry and pick up everything of value that is left in it. It’s now wide open and dangerous in there. Your task is to mark the helicopter with a beacon and, most importantly, find the safe way to access it with vehicle, preferably through the woods. Mark it, I mean the way, with beacon as well. After that, it’s Blue Helmets’ job.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da72": "Stay in good health! I remember that’s how locals greeted me, when Blue Helmets first arrived. My people are now engaged in a very important matter on the health resort premises. Your help would be very well-placed, as usual. We are missing some tools for this work. Knowing your deftness, I think it won’t be hard to get the required items.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da73": "What can you expect when stuff like that keeps happening, fucking shit! We completely forgot about power supply, and our local generators are out of order. My people suffer power shortages and it is totally not okay, because time is money. Many have carried out their activities in the resort before us. Search for generators that are still functional, most likely they are in locked rooms on the second floor of both buildings, we’ll need a bunch of them. Just inform me when the rooms are located.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da74": "Hello my friend, how are you doing? Not exactly awesome, I know, that’s just how the times are now. My people have run across some rather curious rooms in the health resort, which are, unfortunately, locked tight. It is known USEC people were stationed there earlier, and also learned that they  stored the keys at the checkpoint, in a concrete bunker, North-West of the resort. Since they packed in a hurry, there is a chance you may find something there.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da75": "Good afternoon. My name is Peacekeeper, and you were recommended by Skier, as a man who knows his value and the value of loyalty too. Let's not waste time and get on straight to business. I need to deliver a certain gear to certain people. I’ll give you all the stuff. Sorry for the accent, professional flaw. I'll give you everything I need moved, and your job will be to leave it all in a certain place - on the Shoreline, next to one of the - what’s it called - breakwaters. There is a boat, and that is where the drop shall be made. Is the task clear?",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da76": "Okay, here’s the next deal.  Russia has kindly provided the UNTAR mission with several Tiger LAVs. Now the mission has virtually collapsed, and the vehicles are left to rot in the rain. I need you to locate three abandoned armored vehicles at Customs and mark them with beacons.  There are still many valuables left inside that can be salvaged and sold, for example, to American intelligence. Unfortunately, I don’t have the beacons now.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da77": "Good day! As you can understand, the conflict here was rather, serious and there is some heavy armor left on the Shoreline. There are at least three T-90 of which I am aware, and I am sure there are many  military devices remaining on them, such as laser rangefinders for example. Those models are not for export, and equipped with optics for domestic use. My customers would be very interested in comparing it to the samples owned by them. Mark tanks with beacons, and my people will do the rest.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da78": "OK, next job. NATO has carefully studied the conflict even before the blue helmets force surge and sent several drones to recon. But local air defence was apparently against democratic eyes. Two drones were shot down over the coast, now that getting to them has become possible, we can try to pull out the memory block from these. They should contain information about all movement at the beginning of the conflict. This information can make a good deal with my partners. Find their impact locations and bring me the memory.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da79": "Our team always works for the good of the people, or at least we try to make it look so. Blue helmets peacefully deliver relief supplies to our region, but sometimes, attacks happen on us as well. That’s what happened to two Ural trucks that were carrying UN-marked crates. We wouldn't be upset if not for the delicacy of the cargo, this time crates contained a little help not only for the people, but also for USEC company. You understand that we cannot allow to cast a shadow on the United Nations reputation. Locate the spot where trucks were attacked, mark them with beacons, and bring me several MRE ration packs so I could present them as evidence, just in case.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da7a": "I’m having this strange feeling lately. You know, you’re not the only person I work with, other people provide me some other services. One, particularly sharp, informant, has been out of touch for while. The last message from him was about strange glow in the area of the old village and voices he heard there. Apparently, he then decided to have a look at what is going on there, and went missing. The settlement was abandoned long ago and mainly consists of wooden huts. Try to find the informant or at least investigate what you can.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da7b": "What you have discovered in the village is very interesting, it looks like some kind of occult sect. I’ve heard rumors before that there is some group actively spreading the news of approaching cataclysm and that kind of hysteria. Now, they often make sacrifices to their gods, and what would you think they offer as sacrifice? Weapons. It is not clear where they take it from or what they do in the rest of their time. We only know that they have several such sacrificial altars everywhere. Find them and mark with beacons, and we will try to trace the activities of this organization in detail, to learn how much democracy they have.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da7c": "Our partnership has been quite fruitful lately, it’s great -- and I want to trust you more. After all, reliable people are always valued high, we are the first to know this. It's time to let you in on the delicate operation I’m running at the resort. However, first I would like to receive from you a certain proof of loyalty - a batch of ears, haha, just kidding. About ears, that is. Otherwise, it’s no joke, if you want in on the operation, I’ll need you to prove your loyalty, not necessarily with blood.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da7d": "A USEC group used to be stationed in the resort, and after this mess broke out, they have left behind a lot of goods, especially in locked premises. My friends have decided that this is a great place for the production of some compounds... After all, isn't it a Blue Helmets’ job to make people's lives easier? However, I only help with necessary supplies, distribution is handled by other people. I'll introduce you to them when the time comes. I hope all you have learned will stay between us. Now go and bring me everything that my friends need.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da7e": "Good day, today I had the joy of understanding that we have a solid operation running, and it was not without your help. Blue Helmets now have tight ongoing partnership with locals in all areas of business, and profits keep flowing in. Anyway, Business comes first, as they say. You have already been by the caved tunnel on the Shoreline. Terragroup attempted to move some cargo through it, but failed -- and now it is temporarily in the storage position, whereabouts unknown. Provisional headquarters for coordinating the company’s activities was moved to the resort when the conflict started, but, obviously, they are long gone as well. However, I think it’s safe to assume that they couldn’t move out everything, and we can try to get some information there. Computer coordination center was based somewhere on the third floor of the resort building.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da7f": "Drives contained even more data than I expected. The cargo is in the resort, but the most important thing is that it got there after evacuation attempt. Since the West tunnel was destroyed, Terragroup folks, covered by USEC, tried to take it back to the port, but it was already roadblocked with the T-90. Hence, they scurried to stow it away, like prudent capitalists, ha-ha. We got to know that the cargo consisted of two parts, the first one, which included blue barrels, is located somewhere in the East Wing, the whereabouts of the second are unknown. Discover that cargo.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da80": "Well, the manifest said that the second part of the cargo is somewhere in the basement, and locked tight. Search the resort and notify me when you find it.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da81": "Hello my friend, glad to see you. It’s great you're still alive, ha-ha. As you can see, me and my people feel most comfy on Shoreline, and we also communicate with our partners and customers from here. We’ve managed to re-purpose the local meteorological equipment to transmit signals. Scavs, however -- or maybe not them -- always try to destroy or damage our antennas. We routinely deal with communication problems, even had to install surveillance cameras. However, it’s a common knowledge that vandalizing gangs only understand violence. You task today is what you do best. Explain them that the weather station and the entire Shoreline is not the best place to damage the Blue Helmets property.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da82": "How nice of you to be here, Sherlock. Those very cameras that we’ve installed on the weather station, filmed a lot of interesting things. For instance, among other things, they spotted a group of Scavs, who looked like sailors or fishermen, dressed in tatters and waders mostly. Lately, however, they have stopped appearing. I take an interest in their activities as their turnaround seems rather impressive. Search the Shoreline for a place where they could possibly live and mark it with beacon for my people.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da83": "You hit the spot there, my friend. My partners are very interested in what this affair can bring us. Helmets inspected the place you marked and found out that some fisherman  lived there for a while. It seems, though, he is long dead, and people on cameras are his friends. However, it is known that he was friendly with certain person called Artyom, who was often seen driving yellow Daihyn. Their shared business was somehow linked to the Russian military, now you understand why it can be fun? Most likely, Artyom’s car remained on the Shoreline after the conflict, it’s a fat chance he managed to drive off with it. Use the provided description to find it, write down the plate number, and we’ll use it to get the details on who that Artyom may be.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da84": "It seems Artyom lived in the health resort after the break of conflict, maybe was connected to Terragroup... or maybe not. No precise info yet. The nature of their joint operation with the fisherman is also not completely clear, but, considering the level of meetings secrecy, I'm pretty sure it's some kind of military tech. We can find from the list of tenants, if it’s still remains intact, of course, where exactly Artyom’s quarters were. Visit the resort management office, such documents could possibly survive.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da85": "Job well done gets well rewarded. From docs we learned that Artyom lived in room 328, and worked there as well, I presume. Find a way to get into his room and if there’s anything left of his records, bring them to me.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da86": "Hello, my dear friend, it looks like we are really close to an interesting deal. On that drive we’ve discovered a partial blueprint of a missile engine that will be exceptionally interesting to the West, because it's deployed on the Typhoon class submarines -- which supposedly are not functional anymore. Also, there have been quite a detailed file on a sailor who served in the Baltic Fleet, a real salty dog, who is now in Tarkov somewhere, and it looks like he has connections to the Navy command. He’s the one we need to get. According to my intel, he sometimes secretly deals with the Scavs, and getting to him won’t be easy. You’ll have to work discreetly, from an ambush. There is only one chance of success, and it is very important not to fail and not to lose such a tidbit for our interests, my friend. My hands are even shaking a bit as we speak, you have no idea how important this is, and missing is not an option. You're a great fighter, but I want to be sure that you are also good in covert action. I need a sniper, and an experienced one, so come back when you’re ready.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da87": "Ah, that you? Ready for serious business? Yeah, yeah. Scary character you, scarier than me, haha. To be short, the tourists are sort of bugging me lately.. Meddle everywhere, waste my people. I don’t like it. I’ll fix you up with some top cash if you raise some hell with them on the Shoreline. And get some of their gear while you’re at it, their chest rigs and backpacks are selling well, I hear.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da88": "Well, since we’re now best pals forever, I think it makes sense to let you in on real business that real folks are running. That last order about the gear was from a certain dude. Peacekeeper is the name - I think you know who it is. Man himself is from UN force, which is here to prevent violence, supposedly. Can’t help laughing, ahahaha! I roll with him from the very beginning of all this fuck-up here. Working here, peddling stuff, stirring shit up and occasionally producing a body or two. To the point, he’s snowed with business and needs a  tough reliable guy, just like you. Obviously, I have my cut. And, as it is easy for you to guess, the opportunity to work directly with imported kingpin is not free. Yeah, yeah, off with that sour snot. Roll 5k bucks my way, and you’ll be doing business with all the benefits of Western civilization.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da8b": "paw paw",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da8d": "Hello,\n\nWe know each other long enough, and there is no possible use for any disagreements now. I'm sure you're interested in our partnership as much as I am. Don't worry, I won't push your trust. I've came into contact with a person who has a large stock of Western medical supplies, and he's willing to sell it to me, but for foreign cash only. If you can help me out with it, let's call it friends again.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da91": "Good day, young man. Many people have tried to escape the current predicament, and some of them behaved like they were not human beings anymore, but for us, medics, nothing has changed. Our job is to save lives, no matter what the circumstances. When the shoreline tunnel collapsed, quite a number of survivors were injured. The ambulances were immediately dispatched to distress call, but, well, I assume you know what has broken out there. Long story short, that’s where they stayed. I know that there were two or three vans, and the chances are high that most of the equipment and medicines are still inside.. If you happen to  find them, just mark them with beacons and  my people will take care of the rest.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da92": "Thanks for your assistance with the vans. We were just in time, even these Scavs didn't have time to pull them apart. While researching the consequences of the tunnel collapse, we’ve run across a Terragroup executive Gelandewagen. It appears that part of the company’s top managers perished there while trying to evacuate. I’m aware that medical research was one the top priorities for the company, and I'm almost sure, that had no time to evacuate its data and materials due to lack of time. Whatever they were doing, I think it can turn out to be very valuable, both for us and for the medical science in general. It can earn us a ticket from Tarkov, even more than one. I’ve regularly met up with certain Terragroup employees to discuss the health care issues, so I was pretty familiar with some of their works. One of my acquaintances, who, by the way, directly reported to that deceased Gelandewagen management, used to live in the health resort building. Let me look it up... here it is, room 306. Inspect it for anything that could possibly be left behind.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da93": "Such an atrocity, two bodies... It can’t be just a coincidence. No wonder, though, the documents that you’ve managed to find are dedicated to some serious research in the field of Immunology, and from what we can understand, they have made some significant progress in that direction. Judging by the signature on the documents, the research was supervised by the head of the Medical Service of the health resort. Quite an elderly person, I’ve met him a couple of times on Health Care Worker Day. Although he was a venerable scholar he preferred the repose of the countryside over the bustle of laboratories and often spent time in the Woods, driving around in a white minivan. Witnessing the success, I believe, could have motivated him to start experimenting on humans, first one most likely being himself, according to medical tradition. Scientists are always like that. Find his vehicle, and, if you also happen to find his blood samples, that would be great.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da94": "Good day, young man. The degree of your deftness never ceases to leave me in  admiration. Naturally, I wouldn’t want you to fall ill, health before everything. I forgot to warn that you had to be careful with blood samples  you brought. I hope you have sustained no open wounds... and washed your hands. On the other hand, who knows how long it has been exposed to sun, wind and whatnot. In any case I would still advise you to pay attention to your health, otherwise it may run out before we evacuate the people and ourselves from Tarkov..",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da95": "Blood is a good source of information. Not as good as proper project paperwork, but good enough. It’s been a while since I last did a research. I remember it concerned assisting a resident virologist with his thesis. Feels like it was, and at the same time so long ago. Spreading of the Internet has made it much easier to exchange information even with colleagues from other countries. I miss this opportunity now to sift through the Scopus database, I am pretty sure that it has the answers to questions that blood sample research has left. Where could one possibly find access to network now, you ask? To address this issue, I was advised to contact the one going by the name of Mechanic. As it turned out, he has access to the Internet, and it’s even relatively fast. I’ve asked him to look up the necessary articles for me. He asked for a small fee for his services, but in the form of a  propellant powder, for whatever reason. It looks like he’s dealing in supply of ammunition or something like that, I was not interested enough to pay attention. Most importantly, he will provide the info we need. Procure what he asks for, and leave it at the specified spot in the Factory. it’s swarming with Scavs in the daytime, so it’s best to do it at night.",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da98": "translation_pending",
      "5abe61a886f7746ad512da99": "Hello to you too. What do you need? Job? Ha! You only need official with transparent wages and care package, or the shades of gray are acceptable as well? Looking for a job, look at him! Whatever. Thought to order you some 6 class heavy armor, but I can see your happy face, that you will fail. So, find me TOZes and bodyarmor, shitty white ones. Gonna boost up my new guys a little. But just not completely run-down, don't bring me useless shit! Payment will be fair. And if you do fine, we can talk employment then. And yes, you've got three days for it.",
      "5ac242f286f774138762ee00": "You’ve got it? Leave it in the corner.",
      "5ac242f286f774138762ee03": "Yes, I'm the Mechanic. I have a lot of work to do. Get to the point, did you want to help? It’s a shame there’s so little time and the programmer unit for PLC100 is out of order. And those orders to boot. Whatever, why am I even telling you this. Assemble me an MP-133, most likely I won’t have time for it, and some parts are missing too. But with more than 45 ergonomics, a laser designator, an extended mag and less than 700 recoil. And compact, too, not more than 4 cells, and accuracy range 200 or more. Then we'll talk.",
      "5ac2430486f77412450b42c1": "Well, in the capable hands this weapon can overthrow regimes and create revolutions",
      "5ac2430486f77412450b42c4": "You have not failed with the shotgun, so you may know your way around tools. That didn’t save me much time though. All exchanges are on fire, hope it won’t start the panic. Nevertheless, the plan remains the same, I think it's not for long. Okay, I need to work. And you, try to get hold of AKSU. With B-11 foregrip, 60-round extended mag, and compact, 6 cells max. Ergonomics over 40, recoil less than 475, accuracy range 100 or more. And, of course, as light as possible, 3.6 kg or less. Yes, indexes here have nothing to do with that. I hope you got it memorized. See you.",

But what if the destination is yourself, what do you know, how you use your reflexes and how many rounds you have in the magazine. This feels particularly true when you're supposed to survive, clinging to this world with your teeth. I need an MP5. With 50-round extended mag, silencer, tactical flashlight and accuracy range of more than 200. Ergonomics above 56, recoil less than 150. Maximum weight 3.8 kg. And decide for yourself what is more important to you, the journey or the destination.",

That M4 turned out splendid, got taken off my hands in a moment. A bear dropped by recently, goes by the name of Dima or something. He needs a sniper rifle Lobaev Saboteur, with a scope and multi-laser device. With recoil less than 300, ergonomics above 43, and weight below 6.6 kg. He said it needs to be a 2000m shot. The guy is serious, so do your best to make a solid build.",

Interesting, all our heroes of past that caused such admiration, where have they all gone.\nWhy everybody turned out empty. Why now, with this chaos around, such folks as Dima became heroes for us. Why we’ve been ignoring such war dogs, and now we’re looking for their friendship. What do you think? I have another order, for R11 RSAS. With accuracy range of 1500 or above. Weight 6.5 kg or less. Also needs silencer, ergonomics more than 42 and recoil less than 220.",

      "5ac244f386f7741356335af6": "Sometimes I think it's good that I got stuck here in Tarkov. The whole world feels like it’s descending into abyss, a gaping, cold abyss. Everything has lost its meaning. People, their values, their thoughts and their goals. They don't know anymore why they should take joy, work, have children. Everyone is tired from the illusion of choice they were offered all this time, from having to work and buy either blue or red cigarettes. It’s happening everywhere, in every corner of the world. And here in Tarkov, we are honest to ourselves. We see it all in an already exaggerated way, without false values, when you don't just decide what laundry detergent is better at removing stains, but how to keep warm at night and where to find ammo for the next lowlife who wants to kill you. Only then, in such honest society, people show their true selves. What do you think? Okay, thanks for hearing me out. Some folks requested a fully packed M4. They need a silencer and recoil less than 250. And mind the weight, no more than 3.8 kg, with accuracy range of 800 or beyond.",

I managed to buy a couple of hundreds by chance. And today the price is back to normal, as if nothing had happened. We need to get into that action while the market is being controlled like this. You already know the Factory well, there are some control boards there. To find them, look for the red emergency lights.

The world has entered a new industrial revolution, though it has moved on from the real world into the virtual one. We create whole worlds, with their own economies and laws. And, looking at what is happening around us I'm almost sure the digital world is more honest and better than real. Much more depends on yourself here. It doesn’t matter just as much where you were born and who your parents were. Okay, I’m almost done with the power supply. Just need a few more details.

He painted different signs on the wall and on the floor, then walked into the middle of a circle these symbols formed, and started placing weapons there. It didn’t look strange, it even made perfect sense to me. It’s natural for people give their gods is the most valuable thing they have, now it’s weapons. I've heard that it's some kind of cult, maybe you've already encountered them. I have now enough power capacity now. Look for some more graphics cards and coolers. And thanks for the package, by the way.",

      "5ac3468b86f7741d6118b992": "Yesterday, someone was banging at the closed door in the kitchen. Sounds weird, right? I absolutely understand that this can not be, but inside there was a sort of irrational fear. Like a child, when you're afraid of monsters under the bed. I think such fears grow stronger the farther away you are  from civilization. When you're among others, as part of the society, even if you find a monster under the bed, you can tell someone about it. And when you're alone in the dark every day, it doesn’t work that way. I’ll tell you what it was next time, since the irregularities didn’t end with it. For example, someone’s jamming my signal, presumably from the Shoreline territory. It’s a hard trick to pull without powerful antennas. Try to look for satellite dishes, most likely they use something that looks similar. There should be at least two, about 400-450 meters away from each other.",

      "5ac346ba86f7741d6118b999": "I promised to tell you about the monster. It was a failed controller, it flipped out and it seemed as if someone knocked at the door. That's how we create fears for ourselves. Interestingly, if I didn’t go and check what that was, it would be turned off in 15 minutes by the shutdown relay. After that, it would be extremely difficult to determine the source of the night sound. That’s how all those stories from the newspapers are born, I assume. I can bypass the signal jammers by reconfiguring their frequency without arousing suspicion of their owner, as if things are still the same as they were. I need a bit of electronics for this I think you can help me with.",

Teaching it to differentiate between faces and look for matches in the database didn’t take much time. Then I wondered, what if we ever create a mind, which will realize itself, what it will be like? The last many years of civilization humans kept becoming more humane. They started treating each other better, started caring for nature, animals. An opinion was formed that principles of human duty go side by side with highly developed civilization and reason. Then, shall it turn out that the mind of the computer, which of course will very quickly evolve into an over-mind due to its high learning capabilities, will also be most humane at the same time? Interesting, right? But we need to deal with these pests already. Install suppressors on the antennas you found, and, just in case, another one on the tower, also there on the Shoreline.",

      "5ac346ee86f7741d6224abcd": "I've been thinking about that thing we talked about last time. Have people really become more kind with the development of civilization? Do they really go hand in hand? All this time, where we believe there is civilization, life has become more comfortable, easier. There were increasingly less worries about security or getting something to eat. It's easy to be humane when nothing is threatening you. The answer to these questions was right before my eyes. The situation in Tarkov has shown us how much kinder we have become. Once the issues survival came to front, it turned out that decent people aren’t more common than maybe 500 years ago. Probably even less. What do you think, are you one of them? Okay, don’t overthink it. I need you to do something for me. However, you will need to remember quite a lot for this job.

At least, all current event look like preconditions to it. I worked here for the chemical plant, as an ordinary foreman. It was a good time, everyone thought so, including me.
